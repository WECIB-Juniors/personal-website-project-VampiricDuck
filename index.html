        <h3>My Bio!</h3>
        <p>I was born in the United States, NC, on January 8th, 2008. Growing up, I loved to play outside and climb trees. We had a tall pine tree in our front yard before we moved that I would always climb and see how high I could make it before becoming too afraid of falling as the branches became thinner and further apart. I've never had one ideal career; my interests always shifted from time to time, and I couldn't make up my mind about what I actually wanted to do and educate myself for until high school.</p>
        <p>During my freshman year of high school, my father passed away from a vehicle accident. This, oddly enough, drove my interest in the justice field—specifically forensics. My newfound interest in forensics, along with a previous interest in medical surgeons, led me to discover a subdivision of forensic science. Since that moment, I've set my sights on forensic pathology—performing autopsies and identifying exact causes of death to help provide another piece to the puzzle in bringing justice to crime.</p>
        <p>Becoming a forensic pathologist is an extensive process that will take at least 12 years after high school. My goal is to take a year after high school and before college to save funds and get adjusted to life outside school. Getting a sustainable job, looking into colleges, etc., would be the priority. After that, it's schooling for 12 years. That's the plan, anyway.</p>
